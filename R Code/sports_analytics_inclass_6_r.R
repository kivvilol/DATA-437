# 1a) (0 * 0.1) + (1 * 0.25) + (2 * 0.25) + (3 * 0.25) + (4 * 0.10) + (5 * 0.05)
#      0 + 0.25 + 0.5 + 0.75 + 0.4 + 0.25
#      expected number of touchdown passes = 2.15

#  b) Median = 2
#  c) Since Expected Value is large than the median, we can conclude the data is slightly right skewed. 

# 2a) P(B int M) / P(M) = 0.35/0.45 = 0.778
#  b) P(M int B) = 0.35/0.65 = 0.538
