# a) ad - bc / (sqrt((a + b)(C + d)(a + c)(b + d)))
#    29 * 2 - 18 * 22 / (sqrt(51 * 20 * 47 * 24) = -0.315
#    ME = 0.225
#    The interval of (-0.315 +/- 0.225) does not contain 0, therefore our correlation coefficient is significant.

# b) alpha = ad/bc
#    29 * 2 / 22 * 18 = 0.147
#    We can determine there is a high degree of association because our alpha is close to 0. The odds of Brady throwing
#    three or more touchdown passes is about 7 times greater if he is sacked less than three times than if he is sacked
#    three or more times.

# c) Q = a - 1 / a + 1
#    (0.147 - 1) / (0.147 + 1) = -0.744
#    There is a negative relationship between sacks and touchdown passes
